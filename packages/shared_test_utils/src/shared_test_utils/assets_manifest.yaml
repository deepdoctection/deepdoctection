# Tier-A Test Assets Manifest
#
# This YAML file tracks small test assets that are checked directly into the repository.
# Each entry represents a single test asset with its metadata and integrity information.
#
# Schema per entry:
#   <logical_key>:
#     path: <relative path from repository root>
#     sha256: <hex digest for integrity verification>
#     size: <file size in bytes>
#     license: <license identifier, e.g., Apache-2.0, CC0-1.0>
#     tags: [optional, list of tags for categorization]
#     description: <optional, human-readable description>
#
# Notes:
# - Keys must be unique logical identifiers (no path separators recommended)
# - Paths are stored as forward-slash separated, relative to repo root
# - SHA-256 and size are computed automatically by the dd-add-asset CLI
# - This manifest is for Tier-A assets only (small files < 1MB typically)
# - Tier-B (Git LFS) and Tier-C (DVC) assets are managed separately
#
# To add a new asset, use:
#   dd-add-asset --key <key> --path <path> --license <license> [options]
#
