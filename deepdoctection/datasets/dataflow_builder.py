    Abstract base class for building the dataflow of a dataset.

    DataFlowBase has an abstract `build` that returns the dataflow of a dataset. The dataflow should be
    designed in such a way that each data point is already mapped in the form of the core data model and thus
    corresponds to a `datapoint.Image` instance. Any characteristics can be passed as arguments and implemented,
    which influence the return of the dataflow. These include, for example, the `split`, `max_datapoints` but also
    specific further transformations, such as cutting and returning an annotation as a sub image. Within this method,
    checks and consistency checks should also be carried out so that a curated data flow is available as return value.
    Such specific transformations should be implemented by transferring a value of the argument `build_mode`.
