    Generates an iou/ioa-matrix for parent_ann_categories and child_ann_categories and returns pairs of child/parent
    indices that are above some intersection threshold. It will also return a list of all pre selected parent and child
    annotations.

    **Example:**

    Let `p_i, c_j` be annotations ids of parent and children according to some category names.

    |**ioa**|**c_1**|**c_2**|
    |-------|-------|-------|
    |**p_1**|  0.3  |  0.8  |
    |**p_2**|  0.4  |  0.1  |
    |**p_3**|  1.   |  0.4  |

    With `ioa_threshold = 0.5` it will return:

     `[[2],[0]], [[1],[],[1]], [c_1,c_2], [p_1,p_2,p_3]`.

    For each child the sum of all ioas with all parents sum up to 1. Hence, the ioa with one parent will in general
    decrease if one child intersects with more parents. Take two childs one matching two parents with an ioa of 0.5 each
    while the second matching four parents with an ioa of 0.25 each. In this situation it is difficult to assign
    children according to a given threshold and one also has to take into account the number of parental intersection
    for each child. Setting `use_weighted_intersections` to True will multiply each ioa with the number of intersection
    making it easier to work with an absolute threshold.

    In some situation you want to assign to each child at most one parent. Setting `max_parent_only` to `True` it will
    select the parent with the highest ioa. Note, there is currently no implementation for iou.

    :param child_ann_category_names: single str or list of category names

    :param threshold: Threshold, for mat given matching rule. Will assign every child ann with iou/ioa above the
                      threshold to the parental annotation.
    :param use_weighted_intersections: This is currently only implemented for matching_rule 'ioa'. Instead of using
                                       the ioa_matrix it will use mat weighted ioa in order to take into account that
                                       intersections with more cells will likely decrease the ioa value. By multiplying
                                       the ioa with the number of all intersection for each child this value calibrate
                                       the ioa.

                           dates which are not in the list.
    :param child_ann_ids: Additional filter condition. If some ids are selected, it will ignore all other children
                          candidates which are not in the list.

                                   parent candidates which are not in the list.
