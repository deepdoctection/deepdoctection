**deep**doctection is a Python library that orchestrates Scan and PDF document layout analysis and extraction for RAG.
It also provides a framework for training, evaluating and inferencing Document AI models.

Check the demo of a document layout analysis pipeline with OCR on 🤗
[**Hugging Face spaces**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/deepdoctection/deepdoctection).

# Overview

- Document layout analysis and table recognition in PyTorch with 
[**Detectron2**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main/detectron2) and 
[**Transformers**](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
  or Tensorflow and [**Tensorpack**](https://github.com/tensorpack),
- OCR with support of [**Tesseract**](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), [**DocTr**](https://github.com/mindee/doctr) and 
  [**AWS Textract**](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/),
- Document and token classification with the [**LayoutLM**](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm) family,
  [**LiLT**](https://github.com/jpWang/LiLT) and selected
  [**Bert**](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/xlm-roberta)-style including features like sliding windows.
- Text mining for native PDFs with [**pdfplumber**](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber),
- Language detection with [**fastText**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText),
- Deskewing and rotating images with [**jdeskew**](https://github.com/phamquiluan/jdeskew).
- Fine-tuning and evaluation tools.
- Lot's of [tutorials](https://github.com/deepdoctection/notebooks)

Have a look at the [**introduction notebook**](https://github.com/deepdoctection/notebooks/blob/main/Analyzer_Get_Started.ipynb)
for an easy start.

Check the [**release notes**](https://github.com/deepdoctection/deepdoctection/releases) for recent updates.

# Example

```python
import deepdoctection as dd
from IPython.core.display import HTML
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

analyzer = dd.get_dd_analyzer()  # instantiate the built-in analyzer similar to the Hugging Face space demo

df = analyzer.analyze(path = "/path/to/your/doc.pdf")  # setting up pipeline
df.reset_state()                 # Trigger some initialization

doc = iter(df)
page = next(doc) 

image = page.viz(show_figures=True, show_residual_layouts=True)
plt.figure(figsize = (25,17))
plt.axis('off')
plt.imshow(image)
```

## Requirements

![requirements](https://github.com/deepdoctection/deepdoctection/raw/master/docs/tutorials/_imgs/install_01.png)

- Linux or macOS. Windows is not supported but there is a [Dockerfile](./docker/pytorch-cpu-jupyter/Dockerfile) available.
- Python >= 3.9
- 2.2 \<= PyTorch **or** 2.11 \<= Tensorflow < 2.16. (For lower Tensorflow versions the code will only run on a GPU).
  Tensorflow support will be stopped from Python 3.11 onwards.
- To fine-tune models, a GPU is recommended.

| Task | PyTorch | Torchscript | Tensorflow |
|---------------------------------------------|:-------:|----------------|:------------:|
| Layout detection via Detectron2/Tensorpack | ✅ | ✅ (CPU only) | ✅ (GPU only) |
| Table recognition via Detectron2/Tensorpack | ✅ | ✅ (CPU only) | ✅ (GPU only) |
| Table transformer via Transformers | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Deformable-Detr | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| DocTr | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| LayoutLM (v1, v2, v3, XLM) via Transformers | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Installation

We recommend using a virtual environment.

#### Get started installation

For a simple setup which is enough to parse documents with the default setting, install the following:

**PyTorch**

```
pip install transformers
pip install python-doctr
pip install deepdoctection
```

**TensorFlow**

```
pip install tensorpack
pip install python-doctr
pip install deepdoctection
```

Both setups are sufficient to run the [**introduction notebook**](https://github.com/deepdoctection/notebooks/blob/main/Get_Started.ipynb).

#### Full installation

The following installation will give you ALL models available within the Deep Learning framework as well as all models
that are independent of Tensorflow/PyTorch.

**PyTorch**

First install **Detectron2** separately as it is not distributed via PyPi. Check the instruction
[here](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/install.html) or try:

```
pip install detectron2@git+https://github.com/deepdoctection/detectron2.git
```

Then install **deep**doctection with all its dependencies:

```
pip install deepdoctection[pt]
```

**Tensorflow**

```
pip install deepdoctection[tf]
```


For further information, please consult the [**full installation instructions**](https://deepdoctection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/).


### Installation from source

Download the repository or clone via

```
git clone https://github.com/deepdoctection/deepdoctection.git
```

**PyTorch**

```
cd deepdoctection
pip install ".[pt]" # or "pip install -e .[pt]"
```

**Tensorflow**

```
cd deepdoctection
pip install ".[tf]" # or "pip install -e .[tf]"
```



### Running a Docker container from Docker hub

Pre-existing Docker images can be downloaded from the [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/deepdoctection/deepdoctection).

```
docker pull deepdoctection/deepdoctection:<release_tag> 
```

Use the Docker compose file `./docker/pytorch-gpu/docker-compose.yaml`.
In the `.env` file provided, specify the host directory where **deep**doctection's cache should be stored.
Additionally, specify a working directory to mount files to be processed into the container.

```
docker compose up -d
```

will start the container. There is no endpoint exposed, though.

## Credits

We thank all libraries that provide high quality code and pre-trained models. Without, it would have been impossible
to develop this framework.
